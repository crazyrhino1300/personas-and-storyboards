        <h1 class = "Header"> Evaluating the Ratty Drink Machine</h1>
        <p class = "mid"> As an avid patron of Brown's ~beloved~ Sharpe refectory (Ratty), it's no surprise
            that patrons have mixed feelings about the Ratty's food; I myself am often conflicted. Hit-or-miss 
            is the adjective that best describes the Ratty; but I've always wondered 
            what people's opinions were about the drink experience.

                        This sketch shows a rough idea of what the interface 
                        looks like. The screen contains many circular buttons to 
                        choose a beverage, and the right lever under the screen 
                        dispenses the beverage.

            In order to better understand the experience of Ratty beverage 
            drinkers, I developed a series of questions to interview 
            random Ratty patrons with, and I ultimately developed two personas and 
            storyboard based on these interviews.

                Upon observing the drink machine, there were two points of interaction
                that I wanted to learn more about: the landing page to select 
                a drink, and the lever/space under the actual dispenser. I thought 
                that, given the layout of the drink choices on the landing page, 
                that different users would interact differently with the screen in 
                order to facilitate their experience, so I designed the following questions 
                to investigate this:

                    <li>What are some limitations that you experience in the using

                        If your drink was dispensed by both the milk dispenser and

    <h1>Part 2: Recording Observations</h1>
    <p> While interviewing Ratty patrons, I identified three key users that exemplified what
        I thought to be defining archetypical behaviors and thoughts. </p>
    <div class = "observations">
        <div class = "ind-obv">
            <ul> 
                <div class = "obv-head"> From a water drinker: </div>
                <li>
                    First impression: many many bubbles and circles to press on the 
                    landing screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was difficult to navigate the drink selection page if you weren't 
                    already familiar with the layout. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The number of buttons presented was also overwhelming, which deterred
                    this user from exploring other possible drinks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This user was a water drinker, so her main vessel of choice
                    was usually either the provided the cups, but also her waterbottle.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    This user also felt that the space between the dispenser and the 
                    ice tray was too small, as it often didn't allow bottles to fit under 
                    the dispenser.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li> 
                    The first thing that jumps out are the contrasting colors, both on
                    the actual machine and the screen of the machine. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This user felt that the organization of the drink choices made it 
                    easy to navigate and select a drink.
                </li>
                <ul> 
                    <li> 
                        Drinks of the same category were clustered together, which made 
                        it easy to filter what the user wanted and didn't want.
                    </li>

                <li>
                    No true limitations, except potentially cumbersome navigation of 
                    sub-flavors for certain sodas.
                </li>
                <ul> 
                    <li>
                        This implementation is the best of all options, as displaying
                        all options would clutter the landing page.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <li> 
                    This user often used a cup to get his beverages.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    If this user could use a simpler UI, like the milk machine, to get 
                    the same drink, he would.

                    Other than that, this user doesn't pay attention to the center of 
                    the screen, rather; he immediately directs his attention to the 
                    borders to choose drinks like water or non-soda beverages. 

                    In terms of the organization of the other beverages, he feels that
                    it is quite messy and scattered; it would be better to have it in 
                    rows in his opinion. He also feels that having it more uniformed and
                    organized with water in a more expectable place would be better. -->
                <li>
                    Larger subdivision by juice, soda, etc. makes it easy to filter type

                    Current limitations include the organization of the drink choices,

                    His waterbottle frequently does not fit under the machine, and it makes
                    refilling the water bottle hasslesome.

                <li>

                This Qristen Quahog's empathy map; She represents the archetypical
                behavior of a drink dispenser-user who typically gets soda or a 
                non-water beverage at the dispenser. Qristen faces long lines and 
                delays when trying to get a drink with her meal. As a soda drinker, 
                Qristen feels that the interface is easy to use, since she is accustomed to
                drinking Dr. Pepper everyday; she is extremely proficient in navigating 
                the interface. The only 
                slight limitation was that it took a little more effort to reach 
                sub-flavors of certain sodas, but she feels that there are no better
                alternatives, so she is content with this implementation.
                <br> <br>
                Qristen represents the archetypical soda-drinker at the Ratty. Based
                on observation, soda drinkers are much more attuned to the layout of 
                the soda and non-water beverage layout of the machine, which makes it 
                much easier for these users to use the machine, as shown in Qristen's
                empathy map. From observation, soda drinkers are also much more 
                likely to use cups as their containing vessel, which is reflected
                in Qristen's empathy map as well.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p class = "persona-desc">
                This is Carter Providence's empathy map; he represents the 
                archetypical behavior of a drink dispenser-user who typically 
                gets water at the dispenser. Carter's main challenges include 
                indecision and pressure to make a decision. As Carter experiences, 
                the drink machine's interface has many options for non-water beverages, 
                and as someone who doesn't typically drink non-water beverages, 
                browsing these other beverages often feels pressure-some, especially
                when there's a line forming. Carter's main challenge in using the 
                machine lies in the relatively scattered organization of the 
                drink choices and its difficult browsing for less-familiar users. 
                Carter also likes to fill up his water bottle at the drink dispenser
                after his meals. Another main challenge with this interface that it 
                only allows for vessels up to a certain height to fit under the 
                machine, so he finds it difficult to fill up his water bottle without
                either making a mess or having to use another cup to transfer 
                water into his bottle. 
                <br> <br>
                Carter represents users who often use the drink machine just for 
                water, or typically don't use the machine at all. Upon interviewing
                non-soda drinkers, they express discontentment with how difficult
                the machine can be to navigate when trying to try a new drink, especially
                during peak hours. These non-soda drinkers also tend to carry larger
                waterbottles, which they often face difficulty with when trying to 
                refill them at the drink dispenser.

    <p>
        Final conclusions: In general, for soda-drinkers, the machine seems to be
        well designed. Generally easy to navigate if you know what you want. But for 
        users who typically drink water and aren't used to navigating the system, 
        it can be difficult to use sometimes, especially under pressure. As such, 
        a redesign of this machine would ideally increase the usability for those
        users who aren't as familiar with sodas and non-water beverages.
